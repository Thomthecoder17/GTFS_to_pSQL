# GTFS_to_pSQL
Some SQL and Python scripts to set up a postgreSQL database for GTFS data. This project was going to do more, but I quickly found out that OpenTripPlanner already handled what my PostgreSQL database would do.
## How To Use:
Run the python script using formatFeed to generate a SQL file to help set up a database for GTFS files. This SQL file can thn be editied, or can be sent to a PostgreSQL database. FormatFeed is just an example GTFS feed with all of the csv headers, but no actual transit data.
## License:
I'm not going to bother with a license for this. Do whatever you want with it.
